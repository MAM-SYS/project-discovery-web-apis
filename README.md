Full async web APIs for Subfinder and Nuclei tools

The main strenght points of this project are async APIs and high availability without any third-party service.


Note:

  Prefered database store for these kind of projects are NoSQL databases to store the logs(Like MongoDB, BerkeleyDB, ...)
  
  But I used sqlite3 temperarly for now
